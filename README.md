## Usage

* Add enough empty rows (`سطر جدید`).
* Put the cursor on the group Field of first row. (pointed in picture)
* Add desired courses in the code. for example: `TypeCourse("4302110", "02");`

> `TypeCourse("course number", "group");`

* As long as compilation might take some time, Run the program once, that final usage runs faster.
* Whenever all numbers were written, You just press Sumbit button (`اعمال تغییرات`).
* Have a good semester.


**Note than all of the desired courses must be available and if only one of the courses is unavailable, none of the desired courses can be picked. so make sure that all of the courses are available.**
