# Golestan Course Picker

This project can help you picking courses immidiately on course picking day.
It types the digits instead of you.

> This Project is tested on `golestan.sbu.ac.ir` (Shahid Beheshti University). It might not work on other Golestan systems properly.

## Usage

* Add enough empty rows.
* Put the cursor on the group Field of first row.
* Add desired courses in the code. for example: `TypeCourse("4302110", "02");`
* As long as compilation might take some time, Run the program once, that final usage runs faster.
* Whenever all numbers were written, You just press Sumbit button (`اعمال تغییرات`).
* Have a good semester.


**Note than all of the desired courses must be available and if only one of the courses is unavailable, none of the desired courses can be picked. so make sure that all of the courses are available.**
